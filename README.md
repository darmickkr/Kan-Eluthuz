# Lingual AI Braille Technology

## Project Description
Lingual AI Braille Technology is an innovative application designed to convert regional languages, Initally we starting with Tamil, into Braille. This digital solution aims to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals in Tamil-speaking communities, addressing the challenges they face in accessing educational content in their native language.

## Overview
The Lingual AI Braille app tackles the critical issue of limited Braille learning tools available for speakers of regional languages. Our comprehensive system translates Tamil text and PDFs into Braille using the custom-built Sorkal Algorithm. Additionally, the app features an AI voice assistant that provides step-by-step guidance and employs OCR technology for text extraction from images.

## Key Features
- **Regional Language to Braille Translation**: Seamlessly converts Tamil texts and PDFs into Braille.
- **Sorkal Algorithm**: A custom algorithm designed for accurate translation of Tamil to Braille.
- **AI Voice Assistant**: Offers interactive guidance throughout the translation process.
- **OCR Technology**: Extracts Tamil text from images and converts it to Braille.
- **Document Storage**: Saves converted documents for future reference.
- **Hardware Integration**: Provides Braille feedback via interactive hardware.

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python, C#
- **Frameworks**: Flutter, Flask
- **Hardware**: Arduino Mega, Bluetooth modules, Tactile Push Buttons
- **Testing Tools**: Postman for API integration and testing
- **Custom Algorithm**: Sorkal Algorithm for Tamil to Braille translation

## Important Notice
Due to ongoing efforts towards paper publication, the source code of this project is currently unavailable. However, you are welcome to explore the project output for a demonstration of its functionality.

## Conclusion
Lingual AI Braille Technology is a pioneering project designed to empower visually impaired individuals by providing an efficient and accessible translation solution from regional languages to Braille. As we continue to refine the project and prepare for publication, we are excited about its potential to make a meaningful impact on the lives of blind communities in Tamil-speaking regions.
